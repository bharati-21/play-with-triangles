# Play With Triangles
A fun application created using ReactJS that tests your knowledge of triangles, areas, properties, and their types!

### This application tests users knowledge of triangles and it's types.

## WORKING
1. User has five choices presented as button tabs:
   1. Check if the angles entered by the user forms a valid triangle.
   2. Find the hypotenuse of the triangle after user enters base and height.
   3. Find area of the triagnle after user enters base and height.
   4. Guess the third angle of a triangle for the two auto generated angles.
   5. Quiz on triangles that tests your knowledge on equilateral, scalene, isosceles triangles, obtuse and acute angle in triangles.

## My Learnings
- My key takeaway was developing an understanding of how multiple states are managed in an application. I also learned how to create dynamic user menu options.
- An understanding of hooks and state management

## Challenges
- One major challenege I faced was handling states for the user's answers to questions, and resetting the state when user changes answers or retakes the quiz.
- Another challenge was adding styles to specific questions that user answered incorrectly or answered correctly. Since DOM selectors could not be used, I realized this could be solved by styling elements using classes.
